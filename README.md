SENTINA-SENTIMENT BASED TWITTER REPLY BOT

SENTINA  is a sentiment based tweet replying bot. It is based on the principle of Sentiment Analysis which is a topic of Natural Language Processing. Natural Language is one of the major subfield of Computer science or Artificial Intelligence.

The basic function of our App or Python Script is to read the tweets mentioned to a particular profile in Twitter.  The read tweets are analyzed to find the sentiment of the tweet. Sentiment here range between Positive, Negative and Neutral. Once the sentiment of the tweet is analyzed, we reply to the tweet automatically without manual input using pre-written messages. The pre-written messages are marked for different sentiments, which will be used accordingly when the sentiment is analyzed.
